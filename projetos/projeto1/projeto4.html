                <br>
                This phrase has two essential points for me: a side of permanent anguish that doesn't allow us to
                achieve what we want, and another side of an unattainable desire for the time we need but don't have,
                which therefore holds us back and doesn't allow us to conceive everything we idealize.
                My composition essentially focuses on these points. It consists of the representation of a post-it note,
                in other words, a note, but on the scale of a poster, what would normally be on such a note would be an
                idea or a motivational phrase, in this case, it's the opposite of that, that phrase is a distressing
                trigger of anxiety and melancholy for something unattainable due to lack of time. And what I'm asking
                myself with this is: Should we attach so much importance to it?
                If you think about it, that's a 1st world problem and it's somewhat irrelevant compared to so much
                that's going on in the world. It is in this sense that my animation unfolds, the words that I connect to
                the anguish fade away and all the desire and unhappiness caused by the lack of time remain, but they are
                consumed by ink that spreads all over the post-it and ends up destroying the initial “note”, making it
                lose the importance previously given in vain.
